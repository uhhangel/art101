					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use what we know about jquery and the dom to generate text when a button is clicked.</p>
			</div>
                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I ran into with this lab was my css not showing up. It wasn't reading properly due to the css pathway being wrong in the head of my html. Luckily, I was able to figure it out with the help of WesBot. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty easy for me, but I did get pretty caught up on my CSS not working. When I was able to figure it out though, it was fun to just generate new text bubbles.</p>
