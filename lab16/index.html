					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to experiment with API's and AJAX.</p>
			</div>
                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I couldn't get my API to come up even in my console. I was able to figure it out with the help of WesBot and my partner.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was able to use the yes or no API and have it show up in my console. I also customized my site.</p>
