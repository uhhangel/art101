					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to experiment with loops. </p>

                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a problem with the numbers not showing up or counting on my site. After talking with my partner and help from Wesbot we were able to figure this out so it would appear on the site. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a bit of a challenge since there wasn't an example of Wes' js code, but luckily I was able to figure it out and complete the lab.</p>
