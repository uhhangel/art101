					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to experiment with javascript and write functions that take user input.</p>
			</div>
                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I came across with this lab was getting the new sorted input to show up. After asking Wesbot, I was able to find out that my code needed to be inside the click function. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a decent challenge in my understanding of functions and user input, but I was able to figure it out.</p>
