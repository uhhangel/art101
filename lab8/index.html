			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge was to experiment with creating arrays and functions in javascript, as well as using maps and anonymous callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble with my js code when it came to remembering how to test code with console.log, but I eventually figured it out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab was fairly easy once I realized what was being asked of me. I was able to create an array and perform an operation on it through the console. </p>
