				<h1> Hello World!</h1>
				<p>My name is Angelleeanna Bingham and I am a third year AGPM and HAVC major.
			 	I have little to no coding experience, but I am enjoying the class so far. My partner Emily
				is super sweet and a very talented dancer. We both do art and love to be creative!</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was trying to understand how to use CSS and HTML as a beginner to coding in general.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I got confused and accidentally put my introduction into the wrong section, but fixed it quickly. I also had a bit of struggle understanding CSS and how HTML interacts with it, but got the hang of it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this assignment was fairly straight forward. The CSS was a bit confusing at first, but it all came together in the end. I thought I put in a great amount of effort into the lab, tweaking other little things on the site as well.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I was able to change the appearance of the lab using CSS. It took a little learning at first, but I eventually got the hang of it.</p>
