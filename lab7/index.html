			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge was to both create our own code for this lab and create a js code that would randomize a name given on our sites.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble with my js code for a while. The prompt to enter a name kept appearing even after entering one. I was able to fix this though after using WesBot and asking my partner Emily. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this lab was a good jump from the last one in terms of difficulty. It is a bit difficult for me to understand javascript functions, but I got it down for this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> My JS code:</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
                <div>
                        <h2>Script Output</h2>
