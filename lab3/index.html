			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>There wasn't really a challenge I found with this lab. I had most of it set up already within my file system.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problem that came up was that I got a little confused on which index.html was the right one, but I figured it out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this assignment was fairly straight forward. Luckily, most of it was already set up for us. We just needed to include our own personal discoveries and screenshots. </p>
					
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to create file structures and their respective html files. I also updated my site to include links to other labs and included images.</p>
