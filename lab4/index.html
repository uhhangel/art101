			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was to learn more about pseudocoding and using javascript to do so.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had little to no problems with this lab. I was a little confused as to what task 3 meant at first, but then understood after looking at the example on Wes' website. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was pretty easy and straightforward. I was able to create instructions for the basic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors and turn it into pseudocode. </p>
			</div>
	
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> My pseudocode: </p>
					<div id="output"></div>
					
			<div class="pseudocode">
				<pre><code>
	// Get 2 willing players.
	// Each player forms a fist with their hand underneath.
	// Each player hits their fist against their palm three times.
	// Mentally, each player silently decides whether to do a rock, paper, or scissors motion with their hand.
	// Players then count to three and display their motion.
	// Hand beats rock
	// Scissors beats paper
	// Rock beats scissors
	// Paper beats rock
	// Scissors beats hand
	// Players do a best of three, whoever wins two rounds or three in a row is the winner.
