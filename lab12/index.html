                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
			</div>
                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I came across with this lab was getting the new sorted input to show up. I realized later that I had made a typo, causing the code to not work. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty easy. I was able to create a "what smoothie are you?" sorting function instead of Hogwarts since I don't like Harry Potter.</p>
			</div>

                    <p>Prepare to be smoothi-fied.</p>
